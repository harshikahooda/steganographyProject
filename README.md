# steganographyProject

Making a stegano medium and extracting hidden information from it make up the two modules of a project called digital steganography. 

The confidential documents to be sent is camouflaged in an image file in the first module's creation of a stegano medium. The information is needed first, then a user code. Following that, a hidden program is generated using the user code as well as the secret data, which the receiver will use to decode the transmitted data. 

Only those who possess the special code issued by the first component has access to the classified data obtained from the stegano medium module and concealed behind an image. Actually, everyone can view the image, but only with the secret code; anyone cannot view the information.

The projected Digital Steganography programme provides a graphical user interface (GUI), aÂ user-friendly software system that makes it simple to send sensitive information without being detected by hackers.  This system is adaptable and platform-independent, and it supports all Java features.
